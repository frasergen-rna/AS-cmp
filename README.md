# AS-cmp
A set of perl scripts to merge and compare alternative splicing events found from RNA-seq via ASTALAVISTA between samples.

## merge_as.pl
This script will merge splice events from different samples. 

Usage:
`perl merge_as.pl -indir indir -sample A,B,C,D |sort -k1,1 -k2,2n|perl -e 'while(<>){chomp;($chr,$sta,$info)=split/\t/,$_,3;$chr=~s/^0Chr/Chr/g;print"$chr\t$info\n";}' > as_merge.xls`

Parameters:
-indir = is the directory where the files are located
-sample = sample names.

Output is a file with following columns:
1. Chromosome ID
2. Strand
3. Gene ID
4. Gene coordinate
5. AS type
6. AS coordinate
remaining columns are whether AS events occurs in each sample. 1 = AS present, 0 = no AS present. 

## cmp_as.pl
This script will compare the AS events between samples based on the merged output from merge_as.pl. The scripts outputs two files:
1. \*uni.xls = unique AS events in a particular sample
2. \*overlap.xls = AS events common between two samples

Usage: `perl cmp_as.pl A:B as_merge.xls`

- A and B are the sample names
- as_merge.xls is the output from merge_as.pl
